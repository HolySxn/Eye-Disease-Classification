# Eye Disease Classification with Deep Learning (ODIR-5K)

This project focuses on the classification of eye diseases based on retinal images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with residual connections. The model was trained and evaluated on the **ODIR-5K** dataset and achieved strong performance across multiple classes.

---

## ðŸ“¦ Dataset

- **ODIR-5K**: A large-scale dataset of fundus (retinal) images labeled with multiple eye disease categories.
- Each image is labeled with one or more diseases. In this project, we used the **first label** for single-label classification.

---

## ðŸ§ª Project Features

- **Custom CNN with Residual Blocks** for deep feature extraction.
- **Image Augmentation** using `ImageDataGenerator` to improve model generalization.
- **Oversampling** with `RandomOverSampler` to handle class imbalance.
- **Label Encoding** for categorical disease classes.
- **Performance Evaluation** using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.
- **Visualization** of training metrics and classification results.

## ðŸ›  Tech Stack

- Python, NumPy, Pandas
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Scikit-learn
- imbalanced-learn (RandomOverSampler)
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- PIL

## ðŸ§  Model Architecture

- Input: 224x224 RGB fundus images
- CNN layers with Batch Normalization and ReLU activation
- Residual connections (ResNet-style blocks)
- MaxPooling for downsampling
- Dense layers with Dropout for regularization
- Output: Softmax layer with 8 classes

## ðŸ”„ Image Augmentation

Performed image augmentation using `ImageDataGenerator`, including:
- Rotation
- Width/height shift
- Shear and zoom
- Horizontal flipping
- Rescaling

This helped to reduce overfitting and improve robustness to variations in image capture.

- **Total images loaded**: 8,972
- **Post-oversampling**:
  - **Training set**: 7,249 images
  - **Validation set**: 1,813 images
  - **Test set**: 2,266 images

## ðŸ“ˆ Training Curves

- Includes plots of training/validation **accuracy** and **loss** over epochs.
- Implemented `EarlyStopping` and `ReduceLROnPlateau` for stable convergence.
